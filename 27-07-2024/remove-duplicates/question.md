# Remove Duplicates

## Problem Statement

Given a string `str` without spaces, the task is to remove all duplicate characters from it, keeping only the first occurrence.

**Note:** The original order of characters must be kept the same.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
str = "zvvo"
```

**Output:**

```text
"zvo"
```

**Explanation:**

- Only the first occurrence of each character is kept.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
str = "gfg"
```

**Output:**

```text
"gf"
```

**Explanation:**

- Only the first occurrence of each character is kept.

## Expected Time Complexity

- \( O(n) \)

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- \( O(1) \)

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq |str| \leq 10^5 \)
- `str` contains lowercase English alphabets
