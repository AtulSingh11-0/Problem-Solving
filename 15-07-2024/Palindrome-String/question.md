# Check if the given string is palindrome or not using recursion

## Problem Statement

Given a string, check if the string is a palindrome or not. A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** Str = “ABCDCBA”

**Output:** Palindrome

**Explanation:** The string when reversed is the same as the original string.

### Example 2

**Input:** Str = “TAKE U FORWARD”

**Output:** Not Palindrome

**Explanation:** The string when reversed is not the same as the original string.

## Solution

To determine if a string is a palindrome, follow these steps:

1. Reverse the string.
2. Compare the reversed string with the original string.
3. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.
4. Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.
